This is Day - 0 [29-10-2020].

Day - 0:
 	Checking out the functions of git such as commit, push, add, log, status and other functions. It feels nice and really feels like a real programmer
to log our work continously whenever any changes is made.

Day - 1:
	Created my brand new flask project. Finished some pandas work.

Day - 2:
	Learned how to link two or more webpages and learned how to create forms and iterate through them in flask.
